# BM

This is a basic virtual machine written in rust. This project was done by taking guidance from [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0irYsCYuZws&list=PLpM-Dvs8t0VY73ytTCQqgvgCWttV3m8LM).


## Quick Start

```console
$ make examples
$ ./target/debug/bme -i ./examples/fib.bm -l 69
```

## Components

### basm

Assembly language for the virtual machine. For examples see [./examples/](./examples/) folder.

### bme

BM emulator. Takes in a .bm files generated by [basm](#basm) and runs it.

### dibasm

Disassembler for the .bm files genereated by [basm](#basm).

## Primary Motivation

- Learning Rust and understanding how to build actual stuff with it.
- Learning how to implement abstract idea in solid code.
- Getting comfortable with the concept of virtual machines.
- Comparing how development in C contrasts with it in rust.
